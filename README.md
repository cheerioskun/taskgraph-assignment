# TaskGraph Validator and Visualizer
## A take home assignment for Sarvam AI

### Overview
This project implements a TaskGraph class that represents a directed graph with specific invariants. It includes
validation methods to ensure the graph adheres to these invariants, as well as a small webapp that can visualize these graphs
and the errors that might be present.
