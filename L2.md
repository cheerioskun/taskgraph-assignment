## Afterthoughts on the problem
An interesting property that emerges from ensuring connectivity and start+end constraints is that the workflow graphs become COMPOSABLE.
Composability means that each node now can be a workflow in itself, which is the cornerstone of reusability. Once these workflows are reusable and modular by nature, we can start thinking about building a library of workflows that can be shared and reused across different projects and teams.
